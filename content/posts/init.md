Hey all this is my first blog post. The concept of this blog is to educate and show a glimpse of my day to day. I hope to produce content at least weekly to get started.
Will be covering different technology aspects centered around DevOps and Cloud Services. The other will be around general automation tools and services I use to gear up for an engagement.
If your interested in following along on other platforms.
