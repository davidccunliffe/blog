Hi, my name is David Cunliffe. Welcome to my technical blog where I'll be discussing various projects I've been working on over the years.

I've worked for all sizes of companies, from small to medium business up to fortune 50 companies, ranging from DevOps deliveries up to full
blown architecture work designing large scale foundational systems within both AWS and GCP.

My passion is was networking in technology for many years. I enjoy learning about virtualization technologies such as VMware, Proxmox, Docker, and my latest adventures have been within Kubernetes. I've worked work closely with on-premise tech for the first part of my technology career.
Over the last decade I've spent most of my time developing my cloud based infrastructure skills to aid in the virtual world. 

My primary goal is to become a multi-cloud Architect which can bring my experience to my clients. Ultimately working my way into a position that
will support my long term goals. I spent most of my life working in non-profit and disability when I started in the job market. Most of the folks
in this industry have to rely on donations or support from companies. I want to be there to help with my connections and technology understanding
to support their causes. 

While my experience is diverse, I'm always looking for feedback to improve on my own internal processes. I've worked with some exceptional people and completed some insaine projects. I hope to take you on a similar ride through my blogging experience. So please contact me if you would like to have be review any new and exciting technology that your having trouble understanding.
